# Hermes

"The Hermes Standard for vendor-independent machine-to-machine communication in SMT assembly" is a new, non-proprietary open protocol, based on TCP/IP- and XML, that takes exchange of PCB related data between the different machines in electronics assembly lines to the next level. It was initiated and developed by a group of leading equipment suppliers, bundling their expertise in order to achieve a great step towards advanced process integration. And the story continues: The Hermes Standard Initiative is open to all equipment vendors who want to actively participate in bringing the benefits of Industry 4.0 to their customers.
